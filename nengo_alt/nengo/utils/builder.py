def remove_passthrough_nodes(objs, connections):  # noqa: C901
    """Returns a version of the model without passthrough Nodes

    For some backends (such as SpiNNaker), it is useful to remove Nodes that
    have 'None' as their output.  These nodes simply sum their inputs and
    use that as their output. These nodes are defined purely for organizational
    purposes and should not affect the behaviour of the model.  For example,
    the 'input' and 'output' Nodes in an EnsembleArray, which are just meant to
    aggregate data.

    Note that removing passthrough nodes can simplify a model and may be useful
    for other backends as well.  For example, an EnsembleArray connected to
    another EnsembleArray with an identity matrix as the transform
    should collapse down to D Connections between the corresponding Ensembles
    inside the EnsembleArrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objs : list of Nodes and Ensembles
        All the objects in the model
    connections : list of Connections
        All the Connections in the model

    Returns the objs and connections of the resulting model.  The passthrough
    Nodes will be removed, and the Connections that interact with those Nodes
    will be replaced with equivalent Connections that don't interact with those
    Nodes.
